        <h3>What is the Trend Radar?</h3>
        <p>
          The Traco Power Trend Radar is a listing of technologies, regulatory factors, market trends and &mdash; in general important considertaions across the whole value-chain &mdash; complemented by a high-level assessment of our position on them, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ACT</strong> &mdash; Trends to which a timely reaction is highly relevant to our bottom line.</li>
          <li><strong>PREPARE</strong> &mdash; Trends we expect to have a significant impact on our bottom line and/or parts of our value-chain which should be addressed in the near future.</li>
          <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Trends that may affect our bottom-line and/or individual parts of our value-chain in the future.</li>
          <li><strong>WATCH</strong> &mdash; Trends that have significant potential to affect our bottom-line and/or parts of our value-chain in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The web application is based on the <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Zalando Tech Radar</a> with changes collected and given back to the community in this <a href="https://github.com/AndBu/traco-power-trend-radar">public repository</a>

        <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
        <p>
          The Traco Power Trend Radar is a tool to inspire and support critical discussions among internal stakeholders of the Traco Power group; it provides a platform to share knowledge and reflect on new technologies and changes in the market, distribution and regulatory landscapes. The content shall not be interpreted as a ground truth or a management directive.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
        <p>
          The Trend Radar is maintained by internal stakeholerds at Traco Power. The overview is updated based on their input. Assignment of technologies to rings as well as the assignment of priorities are the outcome of internal discussions. The Trend Radar depends on active participation and input from all members.
